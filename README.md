Cubemen Key Config
==================

To change the default gameplay keys in the game Cubemen since it has no way of doing so. This works by accepting the configured key in the ini file and	sending the default game key to the game in it's place. An example would be	to configure Sell Unit to the s key, and when you press s, x is actually sent to the game. This is safe for use while not in the game.

Usage: Just run the script or the executable and fir the first run it will create an ini file and tell you about it. Follow the intructions provided and then start Cubemen Key Config again.
