Name:           Cubemen Key Config
Version:        1.0
Platform:       Win9x/NT
Author:         D1G1T4L3CH0 <d1g1t4l3ch0@gmail.com>

Description:
  To change the default gameplay keys in the game Cubemen since it has no way
	of doing so. This works by accepting the configured key in the ini file and
	sending the default game key to the game in it's place. An example would be
	to configure Sell Unit to the s key, and when you press s, x is actually
	sent to the game. This is safe for use while not in the game.

Usage:
	Just run the script or the executable and fir the first run it will create
	an ini file and tell you about it. Follow the intructions provided and then
	start Cubemen Key Config again.

Known Issues:
	* The hotkeys remain active while the Steam Overlay is active over the game.
	This may be fixed by adding a toggle for the hoykeys.

Changelog:
	07/07/2012 - v1.0 released.
